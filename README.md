<br>𝄞 𓂃 ˖
	<br>ive had a special interest in c!tommy and c!discduo since tommy has joined the dsmp.
	<br>c!discduo is what i am most known for, they are my babies. i am not a c!dream defender though.
	<br>dont let that fool you, i hate the &quot;dream&quot; smp. ive written and comic-ized my own story with its characters.
	<br>one day, i will share that publicly once i feel comfortable within the community.
	<br>my pride and joy is a full c!discduo ita bag and full shelf of c!discduo.
