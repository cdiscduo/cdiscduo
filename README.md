<p style="text-align: center;">hi, im sawyer. i am 20 and go by he/she, as well as being a boygirl - girlgay.
	<br>i am a full-time college junior biochemist who studies aquatic life.
<br>online, i am very shy and sensitive. i will still chat, i love talking to others despite my silence.
<br>𝄞 𓂃 ˖
	<br>ive had a special interest in c!tommy and c!discduo since tommy has joined the dsmp.
	<br>c!discduo is what i am most known for, they are my babies. i am not a c!dream defender though.
	<br>dont let that fool you though, i hate the &quot;dream&quot; smp. ive written and comic-ized my own story with its characters.
	<br>one day, i will share that publicly once i feel comfortable within the community.
<br>˖ 𓂃 ♫
	<br>i enjoy artists nicole dollanganger and ethel cain very much, as well as many others.
	<br>i collect many different things. my collection pride and joy is a full c!discduo ita bag, as well as a full shelf of them.
